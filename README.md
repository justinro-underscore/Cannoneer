# Cannoneer

![Alt text][ship]

Cannoneer is a horizontal shooter with vertical shooter mechanics. In the game, you take control of a pirate ship, and must evade and destroy enemy ships that appear above an  below you, using your port and starboard side cannons. The game takes on a horizontal shooter feel, as the game moves from left to right and enemies come from the right side of the screen as opposed to the left, but all of the shooting occurs on the vertical y-axis. Shooting has a cool-down, simulating a cannon reloading, which means players have think twice about the shots they take. The game is meant to be an arcade game housed within a cabinet with very simple controls.
